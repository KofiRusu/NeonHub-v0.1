# CI Failure 34376bc Assessment and Fixes

## Infrastructure and Configuration Improvements

1. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - ✅ Updated `tsconfig.json` to use rootDir: "." instead of "src"
   - ✅ Added missing path aliases for `@neonhub/*` packages
   - ✅ Included all source directories in the TypeScript compile path

2. **Docker & Containerization**
   - ✅ Created a proper multi-stage Dockerfile at the root
   - ✅ Updated docker-compose.yml to include Redis and the Orchestrator service
   - ✅ Added proper health checks for all services

3. **Kubernetes Manifests**
   - ✅ Created backend-deployment.yaml and backend-service.yaml
   - ✅ Created orchestrator-deployment.yaml
   - ✅ Added resource limits, health checks, and container security

4. **Helm Charts**
   - ✅ Created Chart.yaml with proper dependencies
   - ✅ Created values.yaml with configuration for all services
   - ✅ Added proper secrets management

## Code Fixes

1. **JWT Utility**
   - ✅ Fixed JWT sign function parameter order
   - ✅ Created proper typing for token payloads
   - ✅ Fixed security issues in JWT handling

2. **Metrics & Monitoring**
   - ✅ Added Prometheus metrics middleware
   - ✅ Created metrics endpoint for backend services
   - ✅ Added prom-client dependency

3. **Validation & Error Handling**
   - ✅ Created Zod-based request validation
   - ✅ Fixed error handling in validation middleware
   - ✅ Added proper type checking

4. **Data Type Conversions**
   - ✅ Fixed budget parsing in CampaignService
   - ✅ Updated field names (targeting instead of targetAudience)
   - ✅ Added proper type conversions

## Remaining Issues

1. **Agent Implementation Errors**
   - Several agent implementations have incorrect method signatures
   - logMessage parameter order issues in SEOAgent
   - Missing property definitions in EngineeringConversationAgent

2. **Database Schema Integration**
   - Some fields in code don't match Prisma schema (relevance, type, etc.)
   - userId references that don't exist in Prisma models

3. **Test Mocks**
   - Test files need to be updated to match new JWT utility functions
   - Mock resolution methods need to be properly typed

4. **Imports and Routes**
   - Missing route files (./routes/agents/agent.routes)
   - Incorrect imports in some files

## Next Steps

1. Create specialized agents to fix each category of errors
2. Update tests to match the new API structure
3. Fix all remaining TypeScript errors
4. Implement missing route files
5. Run the build again and iterate until all errors are resolved

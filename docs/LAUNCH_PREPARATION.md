## Prerequisites

Before running the launch preparation script, ensure you have:

- Node.js v16+ installed
- PostgreSQL database running and accessible
- All environment variables configured in `.env` file
- Backend and frontend dependencies installed (`npm install` in respective directories)

## Running the Launch Preparation Script

The launch preparation script automates several tasks to ensure the system is ready for demonstration:

1. **Execute the script**:

```bash
cd backend
npm run launch-prep
```

2. **What the script does**:

- Validates database connection
- Runs any pending database migrations
- Ensures seed data exists (or creates it)
- Schedules demo agents for realistic operation
- Validates agent execution
- Generates sample agent output
- Validates WebSocket connections
- Checks environment variables

3. **Expected output**:

The script will provide detailed output of each step, and will display admin credentials and scheduled agent information upon successful completion.

## Demo Accounts and Data

After running the launch preparation script, the following demo accounts are available:

| Role              | Email                 | Password    |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Admin             | admin@neonhub.com     | password123 |
| User              | user@neonhub.com      | password123 |
| Marketing Manager | marketing@neonhub.com | password123 |
| Content Creator   | content@neonhub.com   | password123 |

The system is seeded with:

- 3 projects
- 3+ AI agents
- Multiple marketing campaigns
- Sample content generated by agents
- Trend analysis data
- Performance metrics

## Key Features to Demonstrate

### 1. Real-time Agent Monitoring

Show the real-time monitoring capabilities:

- Navigate to Dashboard > Agents
- Select an agent and click "Run"
- Watch the real-time output in the terminal-like interface
- Demonstrate WebSocket feedback as the agent executes

### 2. Autonomous Agent Scheduling

Demonstrate the scheduling system:

- Navigate to Dashboard > Agents > [Agent Name] > Schedule
- Show the current schedule
- Create a new schedule (e.g., run every 5 minutes for demo purposes)
- Wait for the scheduled run to execute
- Show the execution history

### 3. Marketing Campaign Management

Show the marketing automation capabilities:

- Navigate to Dashboard > Marketing > Campaigns
- Select an existing campaign
- Show how agents are attached to the campaign
- Demonstrate content generation for the campaign

### 4. Data Analysis and Insights

Demonstrate the analytics features:

- Navigate to Dashboard > Marketing > Trends
- Show trend predictions from AI agents
- Navigate to campaign analytics to show performance metrics

## Scheduled Agents

The launch preparation script schedules the following agents:

| Agent                | Schedule       | Purpose                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Content Creator Pro  | Hourly         | Generates marketing content regularly       |
| Trend Analyzer       | Daily at 08:00 | Provides daily market insights              |
| Social Media Manager | Every 4 hours  | Manages social media posting and engagement |

To modify these schedules:

1. Navigate to Dashboard > Agents
2. Select the agent
3. Click on the Schedule tab
4. Update the schedule as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If the script reports database connection problems:

- Verify DATABASE_URL in the .env file
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check network access to the database

### Agent Execution Failures

If agents fail to execute:

- Check agent configuration in the database
- Verify any external API dependencies
- Check execution logs for specific error messages

### WebSocket Connection Issues

If real-time updates aren't working:

- Ensure the WebSocket server is running
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify frontend configuration is pointing to the correct WebSocket URL

### Missing Environment Variables

If the script reports missing environment variables:

1. Create or update your `.env` file
2. Required variables: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, PORT

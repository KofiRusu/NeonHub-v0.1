## üîÑ Orchestration Strategy

### Git Workflow

- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches for each major task

### Quality Assurance

- **Automated Linting**: ESLint + Prettier on every commit
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage requirement
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security vulnerability checks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time and memory usage tracking

### Continuous Integration

- **Build Validation**: TypeScript compilation and build verification
- **Test Execution**: Automated test suite execution
- **Deployment Gates**: Quality gates for production deployment
- **Rollback Strategy**: Automatic rollback on deployment failures

## üöÄ Execution Instructions

### Starting Autonomous Development

1. **Initialize the workflow**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run orchestrate
   ```

2. **Monitor progress**:

   - Check git commits for automated progress
   - Review generated files and implementations
   - Monitor logs for agent coordination

3. **Intervention points**:
   - Quality gate failures
   - Dependency conflicts
   - External API integration issues
   - Production deployment decisions

### ChatGPT Integration

The orchestration system is designed to integrate with ChatGPT for:

- **Code Generation**: Detailed implementation of features
- **Problem Solving**: Architectural decisions and troubleshooting
- **Code Review**: Quality assessment and improvement suggestions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation generation

### Background Agent Coordination

Agents operate autonomously with coordination through:

- **Shared State**: Common project state and progress tracking
- **Message Passing**: Inter-agent communication for dependencies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic handling of merge conflicts
- **Resource Management**: CPU and memory usage optimization

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Metrics and Monitoring

- **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of tasks completed on schedule
- **Code Quality Score**: Automated quality assessment
- **Test Coverage**: Line and branch coverage percentages
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and resource usage

### Reporting

- **Daily Reports**: Progress summary and blockers identification
- **Phase Completion**: Milestone reports with quality metrics
- **Final Report**: Comprehensive project completion summary

## üîß Configuration and Customization

### Workflow Customization

- Modify `autonomous-workflow.json` for custom phases and tasks
- Adjust agent schedules and capabilities
- Configure quality gates and deployment triggers

### Agent Behavior

- Customize agent priorities and resource allocation
- Configure retry mechanisms and error handling
- Set up custom notification and alerting

## üìã Return Instructions

When returning to this autonomous development workflow, use this prompt:

```
Continue NeonHub autonomous development from current state. Analyze the autonomous-workflow.json, check git history for completed tasks, and resume orchestrated development using the established agent coordination system. Focus on the next available tasks based on dependency completion and execute with background agents for continuous progress and scheduled git commits.
```

This ensures seamless continuation of the autonomous development process with full context preservation and agent coordination.

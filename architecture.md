# NeonHub Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level architecture overview of NeonHub, including core modules, data flows, integrations, and the **fully operational Custom Agent Framework** for autonomous backend enhancement, debugging, and optimization.

**Status: ‚úÖ MAXIMUM THROUGHPUT MODE ACTIVE**  
**Agent System: 6 agents optimized with 5-minute cadence**

---

## 1. Core Modules

### 1.1 AI Agents & Orchestrator ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- **Agent Registry**: Central directory of 6 active agents (Architecture, Backend, Frontend, DevOps, QA, Docs)
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates agent workflows via GitHub Actions and local execution
- **Auto-Commit System**: Enhanced with `auto:` prefix format and hook bypass
- **Self-Healing**: GitHub issue escalation on 2+ consecutive failures

### 1.2 Campaign Engine
- Campaign definition and scheduling services (tRPC endpoints)
- Execution engine for multi-channel dispatch

### 1.3 Data Models & Persistence
- PostgreSQL schema managed by Prisma
- Historical logs, metrics tables, and audit trails

### 1.4 API Layer
- Next.js + tRPC for frontend-backend communication
- Authentication & authorization middleware

### 1.5 Dashboard & Monitoring
- React + Tailwind dashboard
- Real-time metrics via WebSockets

### 1.6 External Integrations
- Ad Platforms (Facebook, Google Ads) via REST/GraphQL
- CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Analytics (Google Analytics, Segment)

## 3. Custom Agent Framework Integration ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 3.1 Goals ACHIEVED
- **‚úÖ Autonomous Optimization**: 6 agents continuously monitor and optimize every 5 minutes
- **‚úÖ Proactive Debugging**: Auto-lint fixes, type checking, and test generation
- **‚úÖ System Health & Scaling**: CI/CD pipeline monitoring and infrastructure validation
- **‚úÖ Data Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and coverage validation

### 3.2 Active Agent Components

| Agent | Responsibility | Trigger Cadence | Auto-Commit |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| üèóÔ∏è **Architecture** | System design consistency, documentation updates | 5min + push | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| üîß **Backend** | API quality, TypeScript compliance, test coverage | 5min + push | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| üé® **Frontend** | UI/UX consistency, React patterns, component tests | 5min + push | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| üöÄ **DevOps** | CI/CD health, Docker configs, security scanning | 5min + push | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| üß™ **QA** | Test coverage (90% target), E2E testing, regression prevention | 5min + nightly | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| üìö **Docs** | Documentation sync, markdown validation, API docs | 5min + push | ‚úÖ Enabled |

### 3.3 Integration Points OPERATIONAL
1. **‚úÖ Event Hooks**: GitHub Actions workflows trigger on every push and 5-minute schedule
2. **‚úÖ Orchestrator Service**: `scripts/agent-orchestrator.js` with enhanced auto-commit logic
3. **‚úÖ Agent Deployment**: Integrated into CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive validation
4. **‚úÖ Communication Protocol**: Direct file system access with git-based coordination
5. **‚úÖ Results & Feedback Loop**: Auto-commits with descriptive messages and GitHub issue escalation

---

## 4. CI/CD & Automation ‚úÖ OPTIMIZED

### 4.1 Enhanced Pipeline Features
- **Agent Validator**: Validates all 6 agents on every run
- **No Gating**: Unconditional execution for maximum responsiveness
- **Auto-Commit Integration**: Proper `auto:` format with hook bypass
- **Comprehensive Testing**: lint, type-check, test, coverage, E2E
- **5-Minute Schedule**: Continuous optimization and monitoring

### 4.2 Quality Gates
- **Backend**: TypeScript strict mode, 85% coverage threshold, auto-lint fixes
- **Frontend**: React pattern validation, component testing, build verification
- **DevOps**: YAML validation, Docker config checks, security scanning
- **QA**: 90% coverage target, nightly E2E testing, performance monitoring

---

## 5. Git Automation & Self-Healing ‚úÖ ACTIVE

### 5.1 Auto-Commit System
- **Format**: `auto: ${AGENT_NAME} ‚Äì ${CHANGE_SUMMARY}`
- **Hook Bypass**: `.husky/commit-msg` and `.husky/pre-commit` skip auto: commits
- **Commitlint**: Configured to allow `auto:` type and agent scopes
- **Loop Prevention**: Smart detection prevents infinite commit cycles

### 5.2 Failure Handling
- **2-Failure Threshold**: Agents pause after consecutive failures
- **GitHub Escalation**: Auto-creates detailed issues with error logs
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Quality Monitoring**: Comprehensive validation on every commit

---

## 6. Performance Metrics ACHIEVED

### 6.1 Throughput Improvements
- **Execution Frequency**: 12x improvement (5min vs 1hr)
- **Response Time**: Immediate fixes vs delayed batching
- **Failure Recovery**: 2-failure threshold with auto-escalation
- **Commit Efficiency**: Smart loop prevention with immediate commits

### 6.2 Reliability Enhancements
- **Self-Healing**: Auto-pause and retry on failures
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive error logging and analysis
- **Escalation**: GitHub issue creation with detailed context
- **Quality Gates**: All agents have validation checks

---

## 7. System Status

**üöÄ MAXIMUM THROUGHPUT MODE ACTIVE**

- **Agent Execution**: Every 5 minutes + on push
- **Auto-Commits**: Immediate with proper format
- **Self-Healing**: GitHub escalation active
- **Quality Gates**: All validation passing
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Optimized and green
- **Git Automation**: Fully operational

---

## 8. Next Steps for Enhanced Agent Framework

### 8.1 Proposed Enhancements
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implement Kafka/Redis Streams for real-time agent coordination
2. **Microservice Agents**: Containerize agents as independent services with gRPC communication
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Add Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards for agent performance
4. **Machine Learning Integration**: Implement predictive optimization based on historical patterns

### 8.2 Implementation Roadmap
1. Break down into discrete tasks in `docs/todo.md`
2. Implement scaffolding for enhanced Agent Orchestrator with event bus
3. Define AgentInterface TypeScript types for microservice architecture
4. Extend tRPC procedures to emit domain events
5. Configure EventBus (Kafka or Redis) for real-time coordination
6. Build enhanced CI/CD workflows for containerized agent services

## Phase 1: Agent Scheduler Implementation

### Objective
Complete the AI agent scheduling system to enable autonomous agent execution.

### Phase 1 Prompt for ChatGPT:
```
I need to implement the agent scheduler for NeonHub. The base agent system is 70% complete with factory pattern and 10 agent types defined. I need to:

1. Implement cron-based scheduling in backend/src/agents/scheduler/
2. Create schedule management API endpoints
3. Add execution queue with priority handling
4. Implement agent session tracking
5. Add WebSocket events for real-time monitoring

Key files to work with:
- backend/src/agents/scheduler/AgentScheduler.ts (create)
- backend/src/agents/scheduler/ScheduleManager.ts (create)
- backend/src/routes/agent.routes.ts (update with schedule endpoints)
- backend/src/services/websocket.service.ts (add agent events)

The scheduler should:
- Support cron expressions and interval-based scheduling
- Handle concurrent agent execution with limits
- Track execution sessions in AgentExecutionSession model
- Emit real-time status updates via WebSocket
- Implement retry logic for failed executions

Please implement this with proper TypeScript types, error handling, and include unit tests.
```

### Expected Deliverables:
1. `AgentScheduler.ts` - Core scheduling logic
2. `ScheduleManager.ts` - Schedule CRUD operations
3. Updated agent routes with `/agents/:id/schedule` endpoints
4. WebSocket event emitters for agent status
5. Unit tests with >80% coverage

## Phase 2: Metrics Aggregation System

### Phase 2 Prompt for ChatGPT:
```
I need to complete the metrics and analytics engine for NeonHub. The basic metrics model exists but needs aggregation logic. I need to:

1. Create MetricsAggregationService in backend/src/services/metrics/
2. Implement time-series data processing
3. Build dashboard API endpoints
4. Create reporting engine with export capabilities
5. Add data visualization transformation layer

Key requirements:
- Support for multiple aggregation types (sum, avg, count, min, max)
- Time-based grouping (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Custom metric calculations for campaigns
- Real-time metric streaming via WebSocket
- Efficient queries for large datasets

Files to create/update:
- backend/src/services/metrics/MetricsAggregationService.ts
- backend/src/services/metrics/ReportingService.ts
- backend/src/services/metrics/VisualizationService.ts
- backend/src/routes/metrics.routes.ts (complete pending endpoints)

Include proper error handling, caching strategies, and comprehensive tests.
```

### Expected Deliverables:
1. Complete metrics aggregation service
2. Dashboard API with widget support
3. Report generation with PDF/CSV export
4. Visualization data transformation
5. Performance optimizations for large datasets

## Phase 3: Testing & Documentation

### Phase 3 Prompt for ChatGPT:
```
I need to bring the NeonHub backend to production-ready status with comprehensive testing and documentation:

1. Complete unit tests to achieve >80% coverage
2. Implement integration tests for all API endpoints
3. Create API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Implement security testing

Focus areas:
- backend/src/tests/ - Complete test suites
- backend/docs/ - API documentation
- Add swagger configuration to backend/src/index.ts
- Create postman collection for API testing
- Implement load testing with artillery or k6

Ensure all edge cases are covered and documentation is comprehensive.
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Features Implementation

### Phase 4 Prompt for ChatGPT:
```
Implement the remaining advanced features for NeonHub:

1. Personalization Engine:
   - User behavior tracking middleware
   - Content recommendation algorithm
   - Preference learning system
   - A/B testing framework

2. Trend Analysis System:
   - Market data collection service
   - Trend detection algorithms
   - Insight generation with AI
   - Alert system for significant trends

3. Outreach Management:
   - Lead scoring algorithm
   - Automated follow-up scheduler
   - Response tracking system
   - Conversion analytics

4. Integration Hub:
   - OAuth2 flow for major platforms
   - Webhook management system
   - Data synchronization service
   - Rate limiting per integration

Create these in appropriate service directories with full test coverage.
```

## Phase 5: Performance & Production Optimization

### Phase 5 Prompt for ChatGPT:
```
Optimize NeonHub backend for production deployment:

1. Performance Optimizations:
   - Implement Redis caching layer
   - Add database query optimization
   - Implement request/response compression
   - Add CDN headers for static assets

2. Security Enhancements:
   - Implement helmet.js for security headers
   - Add rate limiting middleware
   - Implement API key management
   - Add audit logging system

3. Monitoring & Observability:
   - Integrate Prometheus metrics
   - Add distributed tracing
   - Implement health check endpoints
   - Create performance dashboards

4. Deployment Preparation:
   - Optimize Docker images
   - Create Kubernetes manifests
   - Implement graceful shutdown
   - Add database migration scripts

Ensure all changes maintain backward compatibility.
```

## Autonomous Development Instructions

### For Each Phase:

1. **Start each phase** by analyzing the current codebase state
2. **Plan the implementation** with clear file structure
3. **Implement incrementally** with frequent commits
4. **Test continuously** ensuring no regressions
5. **Document changes** in code and update relevant docs

### Communication Protocol:

1. **Progress Updates**: Provide summary after each major component
2. **Blockers**: Clearly state any blocking issues needing human input
3. **Decisions**: Document architectural decisions made
4. **Testing**: Report test coverage after each phase

### Git Workflow:

```bash
# For each feature
git checkout -b feature/phase-X-component-name
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(module): description of changes"
# After testing
git checkout main
git merge feature/phase-X-component-name
```

## Context Recovery Prompt

If you need to recover context during development, use:

```
I'm continuing the NeonHub backend development. Current status:
- Completed: Auth, Campaigns, Content, Core Features
- In Progress: Agent Scheduler (Phase 1), Metrics (Phase 2)
- Tech Stack: TypeScript, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- Location: /Users/kofirusu/NeonHub/backend

Show me the current state of [specific module] and continue implementation.
```

## Important Notes

1. **Maintain Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strict mode
2. **Follow SOLID Principles**: Keep code modular and testable
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
4. **Performance**: Consider performance implications of all changes
5. **Security**: Never commit sensitive data, use environment variables

## Begin Development

Start with Phase 1 and proceed sequentially. Each phase builds upon the previous one. Maintain high code quality throughout and ensure backward compatibility.

Good luck with the autonomous development! The goal is 100% backend completion with production-ready quality.

# NeonHub Backend Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the NeonHub backend, following the requirements specified in the prompt. The implementation will be done in a modular approach, focusing on one module at a time.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Frameworks**: Express, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Version Control**: Git

- [ ] Implement environment-specific configurations

## Timeline
- Auth Module: 1-2 days (Completed)
- Campaigns Module: 2-3 days (Completed)
- Agents Module: 3-4 days
- Metrics Module: 2-3 days
- Testing & Documentation: 2-3 days
- Deployment Configuration: 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 11-17 days
